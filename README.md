# My Blog
The readme isn't going to tell you anything, you should just head over to the [live website](https://walwal.me) to see what's up yourself.

## Installation
Not sure why you would like to clone my website, but if you insist: 

1. Clone the project
2. You're good to go

This project uses [Yarn 2](https://dev.to/arcanis/introducing-yarn-2-4eh1) with a [zero-install](https://next.yarnpkg.com/features/zero-installs) configuration. Magical, right?

It's built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), so run `yarn develop` to run and `yarn build && yarn serve` to run a production build.
